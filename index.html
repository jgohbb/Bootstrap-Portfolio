      <p>I was born and raised in Singapore, but spend half of my life outside my beloved country -
        studying, working, living and sampling what the world has to offer. It is a small world.</p>
      
      <p>I spend ten years in Australia before moving back to Singapore. Two years later, I got the travel bug
        and took up a postion in California. Not long after I was seconded to London where I spend six years
        working and soaking up the wonderful culture Europe has to offer. Then its on to Canada for another
        two before another secondment took me back to the US. Salt Lake City is where my family take root
        and we have been here for almost ten. My next journey continues and this time its the coding world.
        I love it!</p>
      
      <p>I was fortunate enough to work for a mining company with a global footprint, taking me to four
        differnt continents. During my journey, there were many struggles to adapt but I grew from that
        experience. There were many wonderful memories of the places I have been, the different culture, the
        people and the variety of fooooood. Most of all, I gained life long friends from around the globe
        which I cherished to this day. As far as I am concern, the journey has just begun...again.</p>
